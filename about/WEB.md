# Web

These modules enable the integration of advanced web features into your Pong game.

## • Major module: Use a Framework as backend.

In this major module, you are required to utilize a specific web framework for your
backend development, and that framework is Django.

> You can create a backend without using the constraints of this module
> by using the default language/framework. However, this module will
> only be valid if you use the associated constraints.

## • Minor module: Use a front-end framework or toolkit.

	Your frontend development will utilize the Bootstrap toolkit.
	
	> You can create a front-end without using the constraints of this
	> module by using the default language/framework. However, this module
	> will only be valid if you use the associated constraints.

## • Minor module: Use a database for the backend -and more.

	The designated database for all DB instances in your project is PostgreSQL.
	This choice guarantees data consistency and compatibility across all project compo-
	nents and may be a prerequisite for other modules, such as the backend Framework module.

## • Major module: Store the score of a tournament in the Blockchain.

	This Major module focuses on implementing a feature within the Pong website to
	store tournament scores securely on a blockchain. It is essential to clarify that for
	development and testing purposes, we will utilize a testing blockchain environment.
	The chosen blockchain for this implementation is Ethereum , and Solidity will be
	the programming language used for smart contract development.
	◦ Blockchain Integration: The primary goal of this module is to seamlessly inte-
		grate blockchain technology, specifically Ethereum , into the Pong website.
		This integration ensures the secure and immutable storage of tournament
		scores, providing players with a transparent and tamper-proof record of their
		gaming achievements.
	◦ Solidity Smart Contracts: To interact with the blockchain, we will develop
		Solidity smart contracts. These contracts will be responsible for recording,
		managing, and retrieving tournament scores.
	◦ Testing Blockchain: As mentioned earlier, a testing blockchain will be em-
		ployed for development and testing purposes. This ensures that all blockchain-
		related functionalities are thoroughly validated without any risks associated
		with a live blockchain.
