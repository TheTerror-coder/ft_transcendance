# Server-Side Pong

## • Major module: Replacing Basic Pong with Server-Side Pong and Implementing an API.

In this major module, the goal is to replace the basic Pong game with a server-
side Pong game, accompanied by the implementation of an API. Key features and
objectives include:

◦ Develop server-side logic for the Pong game to handle gameplay, ball movement, 
scoring, and player interactions.

◦ Create an API that exposes the necessary resources and endpoints to interact
with the Pong game, allowing partial usage of the game via the Command-Line
Interface (CLI) and web interface.

◦ Design and implement the API endpoints to support game initialization, player
controls, and game state updates.

◦ Ensure that the server-side Pong game is responsive, providing an engaging
and enjoyable gaming experience.

◦ Integrate the server-side Pong game with the web application, allowing users
to play the game directly on the website.

This major module aims to elevate the Pong game by migrating it to the server
side, enabling interaction through both a web interface and CLI while offering an
API for easy access to game resources and features.

## • Major module: Enabling Pong Gameplay via CLI against Web Users with API Integration.

In this major module, the goal is to develop a Command-Line Interface (CLI) that
allows users to play Pong against players using the web version of the game. The
CLI should connect to the web application seamlessly, enabling CLI users to join
and interact with web players. Key features and objectives include:

◦ Create a robust CLI application that replicates the Pong gameplay experience
available on the website, providing CLI users with the ability to initiate and
participate in Pong matches.

◦ Utilize the API to establish communication between the CLI and the web
application, enabling CLI users to connect to the site and interact with web
players.

◦ Develop a user authentication mechanism within the CLI, allowing CLI users
to log in to the web application securely.

◦ Implement real-time synchronization between the CLI and web users, ensuring
that gameplay interactions are seamless and consistent.

◦ Enable CLI users to join and create Pong matches with web players, facilitating
cross-platform gameplay.

◦ Provide comprehensive documentation and guidance on how to use the CLI
effectively for Pong matches against web users.

This major module aims to enhance the Pong gaming experience by creating a CLI
that seamlessly connects CLI users to web players through API integration, offering
a unified and interactive gameplay environment.
