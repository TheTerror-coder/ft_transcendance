# AI-Algo

These modules serve to introduce data-driven elements to the project, with the major
module introducing an AI opponent for enhanced gameplay, and the minor module focusing 
on user and game statistics dashboards, offering users a minimalistic yet insightful
glimpse into their gaming experiences.

## • Major module: Introduce an AI Opponent.

In this major module, the objective is to incorporate an AI player into the game.
Notably, the use of the A* algorithm is not permitted for this task. Key features
and goals include:

◦ Develop an AI opponent that provides a challenging and engaging gameplay
experience for users.

◦ The AI must replicate human behavior, meaning that in your AI implementation,
you must simulate keyboard input. The constraint here is that the AI
can only refresh its view of the game once per second, requiring it to anticipate
bounces and other actions.

> The AI must utilize power-ups if you have chosen to implement the
> Game customization options module.

◦ Implement AI logic and decision-making processes that enable the AI player
to make intelligent and strategic moves.

◦ Explore alternative algorithms and techniques to create an effective AI player
without relying on A*.

◦ Ensure that the AI adapts to different gameplay scenarios and user interactions.

> Attention: You will need to explain in detail how your AI functions
> during your evaluation. Creating an AI that does nothing is strictly
> prohibited; it must have the capability to win occasionally.

This major module aims to enhance the game by introducing an AI opponent that
adds excitement and competitiveness without relying on the A* algorithm.

## • Minor module: User and Game Stats Dashboards.

In this minor module, the goal is to introduce dashboards that display statistics for
individual users and game sessions. Key features and objectives include:

◦ Create user-friendly dashboards that provide users with insights into their own
gaming statistics.

◦ Develop a separate dashboard for game sessions, showing detailed statistics,
outcomes, and historical data for each match.

◦ Ensure that the dashboards offer an intuitive and informative user interface
for tracking and analyzing data.

◦ Implement data visualization techniques, such as charts and graphs, to present
statistics in a clear and visually appealing manner.

◦ Allow users to access and explore their own gaming history and performance
metrics conveniently.

◦ Feel free to add any metrics you deem useful.

This minor module aims to empower users with the ability to monitor their gaming
statistics and game session details through user-friendly dashboards, providing a
comprehensive view of their gaming experience.
