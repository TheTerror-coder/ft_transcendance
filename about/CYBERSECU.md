These cybersecurity modules are designed to bolster the security posture of the project,
with the major module focusing on robust protection through Web Application Firewall
(WAF) and ModSecurity configurations and HashiCorp Vault for secure secrets management.
The minor modules complement this effort by adding options for GDPR compliance,
user data anonymization, a ccount deletion, two-factor authentication (2FA),
and JSON Web Tokens (JWT), collectively ensuring the project’s commitment to data
protection, privacy, and authentication security.

## • Major module: Implement WAF/ModSecurity with Hardened Configuration and HashiCorp Vault for Secrets Management.

In this major module, the objective is to enhance the security infrastructure of the
project by implementing several key components. Key features and goals include:

◦ Configure and deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) and ModSecurity
with a strict and secure configuration to protect against web-based attacks.

◦ Integrate HashiCorp Vault to securely manage and store sensitive information,
such as API keys, credentials, and environment variables, ensuring that these
secrets are properly encrypted and isolated.

This major module aims to bolster the project’s security infrastructure by implementing
robust security measures, including WAF/ModSecurity for web application protection 
and HashiCorp Vault for secrets management to ensure a safe and secure environment.

## • Minor module: GDPR Compliance Options with User Anonymization, Local Data Management, and Account Deletion.

In this minor module, the goal is to introduce GDPR compliance options that allow
users to exercise their data privacy rights. Key features and objectives include:

◦ Implement GDPR-compliant features that enable users to request anonymization
of their personal data, ensuring that their identity and sensitive information are protected.

◦ Provide tools for users to manage their local data, including the ability to
view, edit, or delete their personal information stored within the system.

◦ Offer a streamlined process for users to request the permanent deletion of
their accounts, including all associated data, ensuring compliance with data
protection regulations.

◦ Maintain clear and transparent communication with users regarding their data
privacy rights, with easily accessible options to exercise these rights.

This minor module aims to enhance user privacy and data protection by offering
GDPR compliance options that empower users to control their personal information
and exercise their data privacy rights within the system.

If you are not familiar with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), it
is essential to understand its principles and implications, especially regarding user
data management and privacy. The GDPR is a regulation that aims to protect the
personal data and privacy of individuals within the European Union (EU) and the
European Economic Area (EEA). It sets out strict rules and guidelines for organizations
on how they should handle and process personal data.

To gain a better understanding of the GDPR and its requirements, it is highly
recommended to visit the official website of the European Commission on data
protection1. This website provides comprehensive information about the GDPR,
including its principles, objectives, and user rights. It also offers additional
resources to delve deeper into the topic and ensure compliance with the regulation.

If you are unfamiliar with the GDPR, please take the time to visit the provided link
and familiarize yourself with the regulations before proceeding with this project.

## • Major module: Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and JWT.

In this major module, the goal is to enhance security and user authentication
by introducing Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and utilizing JSON Web Tokens
(JWT). Key features and objectives include:

◦ Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) as an additional layer of security
for user accounts, requiring users to provide a secondary verification method,
such as a one-time code, in addition to their password.

◦ Utilize JSON Web Tokens (JWT) as a secure method for authentication and
authorization, ensuring that user sessions and access to resources are managed
securely.

◦ Provide a user-friendly setup process for enabling 2FA, with options for SMS
codes, authenticator apps, or email-based verification.

◦ Ensure that JWT tokens are issued and validated securely to prevent unau-
thorized access to user accounts and sensitive data.

This major module aims to strengthen user account security by offering Two-Factor
Authentication (2FA) and enhancing authentication and authorization through the
use of JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
