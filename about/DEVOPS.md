These modules collectively focus on enhancing the project’s infrastructure and architecture,
with the major modules addressing infrastructure setup for efficient log management
using ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), designing the backend as microservices
for flexibility and scalability, and implementing Prometheus/Grafana for comprehensive
system monitoring.

## • Major module: Infrastructure Setup with ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for Log Management.

In this major module, the objective is to establish a robust infrastructure for log
management and analysis using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
Key features and goals include:

◦ Deploy Elasticsearch to efficiently store and index log data, making it easily
searchable and accessible.

◦ Configure Logstash to collect, process, and transform log data from various
sources and send it to Elasticsearch.

◦ Set up Kibana for visualizing log data, creating dashboards, and generating
insights from log events.

◦ Define data retention and archiving policies to manage the storage of log data
effectively.

◦ Implement security measures to protect log data and access to the ELK stack
components.

This major module aims to establish a powerful log management and analysis system
using the ELK stack, enabling effective troubleshooting, monitoring, and insights
into the system’s operation and performance.

## • Minor module: Monitoring system.

In this minor module, the objective is to set up a comprehensive monitoring system
using Prometheus and Grafana . Key features and goals include:

◦ Deploy Prometheus as the monitoring and alerting toolkit to collect metrics
and monitor the health and performance of various system components.

◦ Configure data exporters and integrations to capture metrics from different
services, databases, and infrastructure components.

◦ Create custom dashboards and visualizations using Grafana to provide real-
time insights into system metrics and performance.

◦ Set up alerting rules in Prometheus to proactively detect and respond to
critical issues and anomalies.

◦ Ensure proper data retention and storage strategies for historical metrics data.

◦ Implement secure authentication and access control mechanisms for Grafana
to protect sensitive monitoring data.

This minor module aims to establish a robust monitoring infrastructure using
Prometheus and Grafana , enabling real-time visibility into system metrics and
proactive issue detection for improved system performance and reliability.

## • Major module: Designing the Backend as Microservices.

In this major module, the goal is to architect the backend of the system using a
microservices approach. Key features and objectives include:

◦ Divide the backend into smaller, loosely-coupled microservices, each 
responsible for specific functions or features.

◦ Define clear boundaries and interfaces between microservices to enable
independent development, deployment, and scaling.

◦ Implement communication mechanisms between microservices, such as REST-ful APIs 
or message queues, to facilitate data exchange and coordination.

◦ Ensure that each microservice is responsible for a single, well-defined task or
business capability, promoting maintainability and scalability.

This major module aims to enhance the system’s architecture by adopting a microservices 
design approach, enabling greater flexibility, scalability, and maintainability of the backend components.
