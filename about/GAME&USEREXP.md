# Gameplay and user experience

These modules are designed to enhance the general gameplay of the project.

## • Major module: Remote players

It is possible to have two distant players. Each player is located on a separated
computer, accessing the same website and playing the same Pong game.

> Think about network issues, like unexpected disconnection or lag.
> You have to offer the best user experience possible.

## • Major module: Multiple players

It is possible to have more than two players. Each player needs a live control (so
the previous “Distant players” module is highly recommanded). It’s up to you to
define how the game could be played with 3, 4, 5, 6 ... players. Along with the
regular 2 players game, you can choose a single number of players, greater than
2, for this multiplayer module. Ex: 4 players can play on a squarred board, each
player owns one unique side of the square.

## • Major module: Add Another Game with User History and Matchmaking.

In this major module, the objective is to introduce a new game, distinct from Pong,
and incorporate features such as user history tracking and matchmaking. Key
features and goals include:

◦ Develop a new, engaging game to diversify the platform’s offerings and entertain users.

◦ Implement user history tracking to record and display individual user’s gameplay statistics.

◦ Create a matchmaking system to allow users to find opponents and participate
	in fair and balanced matches.

◦ Ensure that user game history and matchmaking data are stored securely and remain up-to-date.

◦ Optimize the performance and responsiveness of the new game to provide an
	enjoyable user experience. Regularly update and maintain the game to fix
	bugs, add new features, and enhance gameplay.

This major module aims to expand your platform by introducing a new game,
enhancing user engagement with gameplay history, and facilitating matchmaking
for an enjoyable gaming experience.

## • Minor module: Game Customization Options.

In this minor module, the goal is to provide customization options for all available
games on the platform. Key features and objectives include:

◦ Offer customization features, such as power-ups, attacks, or different maps,
that enhance the gameplay experience.

◦ Allow users to choose a default version of the game with basic features if they
prefer a simpler experience.

◦ Ensure that customization options are available and applicable to all games
offered on the platform.

◦ Implement user-friendly settings menus or interfaces for adjusting game parameters.

◦ Maintain consistency in customization features across all games to provide a
unified user experience.

This module aims to give users the flexibility to tailor their gaming experience
across all available games by providing a variety of customization options while
also offering a default version for those who prefer a straightforward gameplay
experience.

## • Major module: Live Chat.

You have to create a chat for your users in this module:

◦ The user should be able to send direct messages to other users.

◦ The user should be able to block other users. This way, they will see no more
	messages from the account they blocked.

◦ The user should be able to invite other users to play a Pong game through the
	chat interface.

◦ The tournament system should be able to warn users expected for the next game.

◦ The user should be able to access other players profiles through the chat interface.
